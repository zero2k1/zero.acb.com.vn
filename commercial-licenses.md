# Commercial Licenses

Should you wish to contribute to a project that requires a proprietary license to do so, <COMPANY_NAME> will need to purchase a license after making the decision whether or not to do so.

If there is no existing proprietary license, an issue can be opened at [Governance, Risk, Compliance & Communication (GRCC)](XXX) or a workflow in Ironclad to begin the process of reviewing the vendor for our data privacy and security protections to purchase a license. See more on the Procurement process [here](XXX).
